### January 2024
I will join the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/futurecitieslab" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">Future Cities Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">Centrale Supélec - Université Paris-Saclay</a> as a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.jakobpuchinger.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">Jakob Puchinger</a> and Professor <a href="https://cv.hal.science/adam-abdin" target="_blank" style="color:#3B528B;">Adam Abdin</a>, focusing on developing novel algorithms for designing, planning, and operating on-demand transport systems in an intermodal context. My research will primarily revolve around data analysis, planning, and optimization under uncertainty for on-demand transport systems within large urban regions. I will also explore the intricate interactions between electric vehicles and power systems as part of this research. Stay tuned for updates on my work at the intersection of transportation systems, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and optimization.
